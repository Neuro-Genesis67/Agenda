TODO Make your app fullscreen:

    console.log("fs running");
    var elem = document.documentElement;
    if (elem.requestFullscreen) {
        elem.requestFullscreen();
    } else if (elem.msRequestFullscreen) {

TODO Eliminate redirects, make the program universal
Make a controller class, possibly welcome.js could turn into that.
Make it able to take loaded modules (js files) and make methods like:
initPage(page/module), and then perhaps that page can handle its own stuff.
This would eliminate hbs and give only one css file (yuck).

OR ... hmmm. maybe a module that will empty the body for elements
after the exit transition.
